The algorithm works in 3 steps:

Applications
1. Initialize distances;
2. Repeat V − 1 times:
• Go through every edge
• Relax it
3. 1 more iteration:
• If any distance improves
→ negative cycle
• Currency arbitrage detection;
• Time-travel constraint
(transport scheduling);
• Longest path (by negating
weights, DAG only);
